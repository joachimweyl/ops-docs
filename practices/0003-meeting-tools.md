## Meeting Duration

When planning your meeting consider planning in a built in end time
before the 30 min mark so that you can allow for meetings to go over and
preparation for a meeting after.

You might even consider setting up outlook to automatically pad your
meetings. [Here][link1] are steps to change the default duration of meetings.
